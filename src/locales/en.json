    "about_aplication": "This project is a simple to-do list app built using React for the frontend and Django as the backend API. The user can add, remove, update and mark tasks as completed. The frontend communicates with the API via HTTP requests using Axios, allowing dynamic task management in real time. The user interface is simple and intuitive, making the solution easy to use and fully responsive. The primary goal of the project was to develop and improve the author's skills in working with modern web technologies such as React on the frontend and Django as a backend API. The ToDo list served as an ideal example for practicing frontend-backend communication, state management in React, and implementing advanced backend features with Django such as data processing and API support.",
